# Suicide Tracker

## Description
Using python visualization tools (matplotlib, seaborn...), I'm trying to analyse the evolution of suicide rate over the years and the difference in suicide between genders.

## Databases
[WHO suicide rates](https://www.who.int/gho/mental_health/suicide_rates/en/)


## Previous beleifs
- Suicide rate is higher for men than women.
- Suicide rate has increased over the years.

## Scripts
- suicide_analysis: Using databases ranging from 2000 to 2016. Checking suicide rate for countries and genders. Also calculating the global mean to check increase or decrease.

- suicide_analysis2: Different format to check the suicide rate and a map plot to easily visualize countries with higher suicide rate.
